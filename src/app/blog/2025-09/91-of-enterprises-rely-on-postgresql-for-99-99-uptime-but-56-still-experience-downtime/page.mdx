When Oxford Economics revealed that unplanned downtime costs the Global 2000 $400 billion annually, $200 million per company on average, it wasn't abstract. It was a concrete financial hemorrhage. Yet here's the catch: a [pgEdge survey](https://www.pgedge.com/press-releases/new-survey-shows-strong-demand-for-high-availability-as-businesses-increasingly-use-postgresql-in-mission-critical-applications-and-to-alleviate-cloud-outage-concerns) found that 91% of enterprises using PostgreSQL require 99.99% uptime, while 56% still exceed their maximum downtime thresholds. 

This isn't a case of "set it and forget it." PostgreSQL's ACID guarantees are rock-solid for transactional integrity, but high availability demands a whole different beast. Let's unpack why so many teams miss the mark.

## ACID Compliance â‰  High Availability

PostgreSQL's [ACID properties](https://dev.to/coder7475/understanding-the-acid-concept-with-postgresql-57e) ensure data correctness during transactions. Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability are non-negotiable for financial systems or e-commerce, but they don't address system failures. 

Consider a bank transfer: the database won't let you debit Account A without crediting Account B (atomicity), and it'll enforce balance constraints (consistency). But if the entire server rack catches fire? ACID won't save you. High availability requires redundant components, automated failover, and continuous monitoring, all separate from ACID's scope.

Many teams assume "PostgreSQL = reliable." That's like assuming a fire alarm guarantees a building won't burn down. The alarm alerts you, but you still need sprinklers, evacuation plans, and regular drills.

## The HA Architecture Minefield

The [Zabbix blog](https://blog.zabbix.com/building-ha-zabbix-with-postgresql-and-patroni/30960/) outlines a robust HA stack: PostgreSQL, Patroni, etcd, HAProxy, keepalived, and PgBackRest. It looks simple on paper, but in practice, it's easy to skip critical steps. 

Take etcd: a lightweight key-value store that coordinates Patroni's cluster decisions. If you deploy etcd on the same nodes as PostgreSQL without proper quorum configuration, a single node failure can trigger a cascade. The Zabbix team explicitly warns: "etcd is very latency prone", meaning network hiccups can break consensus. Yet many teams treat etcd as a black box.

Or HAProxy: it routes traffic to the current primary node using Patroni's REST API. But if you skip health checks for the primary node, HAProxy might keep sending writes to a degraded server. I've seen teams lose data because their load balancer didn't verify replication lag before routing traffic.

This isn't hypothetical. A major fintech firm recently had a 48-minute outage when their HAProxy configuration ignored *all* Patroni health endpoints. The primary node was overloaded, but HAProxy kept routing traffic because it only checked if the port was open, not if the node was actually healthy.

## Sharding: Scaling or Sabotage?

Database sharding, splitting data into smaller chunks across nodes, can improve performance for high-traffic systems. [DB Designer notes](https://www.dbdesigner.net/database-sharding-the-ultimate-guide-to-scaling-databases-for-high-performance) that sharded architectures improve read/write throughput by 300% in high-traffic systems. But shard your data poorly, and you create single points of failure.

![database sharding](/blog/2025/postgresql-in-mission-critical-environments-uptime-requirements-and-best-practices_database-sharding.webp)

A common mistake? Choosing shard keys that don't align with query patterns. For example, using `user_id` for hash sharding makes sense for user-specific queries, but if you need to run global reports across all users, you'll hit cross-shard joins that cripple performance. Worse, if one shard fails (say, Shard_2 for user IDs 10k, 19k), you lose that entire segment of data unless you've configured replication.

Real-world example: an e-commerce company shard their orders table by `order_date`. During Black Friday, they hit a hot shard, the one containing the current day's data, because all transactions were hitting the latest partition. Their "scalable" architecture throttled under load, causing 90-second page load times during peak traffic.

## What Good Looks Like

Achieving 99.99% uptime (less than 52 minutes of downtime per year) requires discipline. Here's what works:

- **Test failovers like a fire drill**: Run quarterly failover tests. Don't wait for a real outage to discover your Patroni configuration is broken.  
- **Monitor all layers**: Track etcd quorum health, HAProxy connection rates, and replication lag, not just PostgreSQL's CPU usage.  
- **Backups aren't optional**: Use [PgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/) for incremental backups and WAL archiving. A company in Berlin lost 3 days of data during a ransomware attack because their backup strategy only included full snapshots weekly.  
- **Separate concerns**: Run etcd on dedicated nodes. Don't co-locate it with PostgreSQL unless you've stress-tested the setup.  

This isn't about fancy tools, it's about rigor. As the Zabbix team puts it: "This setup prioritizes resilience and self-healing." But self-healing only works if you've built the right safety nets.

PostgreSQL alone can't deliver 99.99% uptime. It's a tool in a larger ecosystem. When $200 million per company hangs in the balance, skipping the HA plumbing isn't a cost-saving move, it's gambling with your business.  

The pgEdge survey found 56% of enterprises exceed downtime goals, proof that most teams treat high availability as a checkbox, not a continuous process. It's time to stop assuming "it just works" and start building systems that *actually* survive when things go wrong. Because in mission-critical environments, downtime isn't a technical failure. It's a business catastrophe.
