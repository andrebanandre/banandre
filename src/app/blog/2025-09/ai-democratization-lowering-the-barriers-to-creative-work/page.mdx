The floor is rising faster than the ceiling, and everyone with a LinkedIn account is pretending that's a win.

## When a five-year-old can spin up React code, the apprenticeship model dies

Coding, music making, art, creative writing and research were once special skills, but now even a 5-year-old can do them. AI hasn't made the best better, it has made the worst viable. That's the floor-lift in action, entry-level competence is now built into the prompt bar.

This isn't a footnote for junior devs. It's an extinction event for the traditional stepping-stone jobs that once paid people while they learned:

- Ticket-monkey frontend tasks  
- Blog-post content farms  
- Stock-art commissions  
- Basic data munging that used to be billed at sixty dollars an hour

AI model-as-a-service means someone, anyone, can type *"generate CRUD dashboard with Tailwind"* and ship the GitHub link before lunch. The result is **more code than ever**, but **less need for junior coders**.


## The new creatives aren't masters, they're ensemble conductors with no podium training

Nano Banana, Google's Gemini-based photo editor, will let anyone with a pulse turn a toilet selfie into a Van Gogh. The tool is impressive: identity-consistency across edits, style transfer that actually keeps the subject in frame, and zero need to know what an *"overlay mask"* is. What used to separate hobbyists from pros (layers, color theory, painstaking masking) now lives inside two thumb taps.

Multiply that across music prompt engines, AI drum-masters and design co-pilots and you get the new portfolio paradox:

1. **More good-enough content** floods Fiverr and Etsy  
2. **Median price for gig visuals** drops below minimum-wage equivalents  
3. **Pros can't fund mentoring time**, because margins have evaporated  
4. **Amateurs stay amateurs**, because the AI supply line never forces skill growth  

So the castle gate is open, but inside is a raging buyer's market where good is cheaper than free.

## The bar didn't disappear, it moved to an unmarked cliff

Employers notice. AWS is already telling recruiters that *"curiosity"* is the new degree, while traditional CS foot-in-the-door requirements, small coding tests, GitHub green squares, tech-blog half-fame, wither. AI tools now solve those interview riddles in seconds, hiring managers quietly yank the lever from "junior" to "senior-only."

The cost? A generation that never accumulates institutional wisdom because no one is paid to accumulate it.

- 66% of academics in a 2024 Nature survey reported compute satisfaction **â‰¤3 out of 5**, many can't run large models at all  
- G7 researchers iterate every 30 minutes  
- African researchers? Six-day cycles, because free credits run out and HPC grants are lottery tickets  

AI's democratization pitch caters first to those who already had a seat at the table.

## Flood economics: when abundance becomes the new barrier

Drop a million average songs on Spotify and discoverability implodes. Ditto for micro-SaaS apps, stock-photo bundles, AI-generated short stories. Democratization doesn't scale the revenue pie, it scales the participant line. Result: **royalty checks that look like rounding errors** and recommendation algos that only feed the 0.1% who figured out prompt dark-patterns first.

This isn't luddism, it's supply-and-demand on amphetamines. Once the production cost of digital goods hits zero, **attention becomes the price tag**, and attention still clusters around brands, existing fame, or whoever cracked SEO three years ago. Except now the middle class of creators who funded their climb via modest but reliable commissions evaporates.

## Prepare for the brutal bottleneck: gatekeepers re-arm

The end-game isn't a pastoral commune where everyone paints and codes for joy. Platforms quietly re-insert gatekeeping:

- YouTube labels AI-generated voices as *"synthetic content"* and dings discoverability  
- Coursera's AI certificate quizzes require proctor AI, bad grammar, no pass  
- Adobe reserves high-tier training data for verified *"creative cloud professionals"*  

Today's guilds must re-certify on AI-enhanced skills, but the new passwords change quarterly. If you can't afford the GPU hours, the premium prompts, or the compliant data sets, you stay outside the new wall, still democratized, still locked out.

Generative AI is a floor-raiser and a ceiling-ignorer. It replaces *learning time* with *output now*, which feels like liberation until you realize the long-term rent comes due in the form of stagnating wages, devalued portfolios and hiring managers who shrug at anything that isn't already viral. The same tool that lets you compose your first EDM track is quietly deleting the junior sound-designer job you were aiming for.

So yes, a five-year-old can code, but they'll grow into a world where no one pays for code at all.
