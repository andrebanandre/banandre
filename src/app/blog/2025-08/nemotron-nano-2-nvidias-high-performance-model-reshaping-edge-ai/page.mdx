Transformer models face increasing computational costs as context length expands. Edge AI applications require inference latency compatible with commodity GPUs, while maintaining the capacity to handle complex reasoning and multilingual tasks.  

The Nemotron Nano 2 aims to reconcile these demands by demonstrating that a 9B-parameter model can perform on a single A10G GPU what larger models require for comparable results.

### Technical Innovations and Tradeoffs  

#### Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Architecture  

- **Mamba (State-Space Model)**: Implements linear-time processing for long sequences, avoiding quadratic memory scaling.  
- **Transformers**: Four standard attention layers retain global dependency tracking.  
- **Throughput**: On an A10G in bfloat16, the 9B variant processes tokens at approximately 6x the rate of Qwen-3-8B.  

*Note*: Performance gains are tied to NVIDIA-specific optimizations for state storage in DPUs.  

#### Extended Context Handling  

- **128K Token Window**: Achieved through model compression to 22GiB, enabling document-level reasoning and long dialog sessions on a single GPU.  

#### Reasoning Control Mechanism  

- `/think`: Generates step-by-step reasoning traces.  
- `/no_think`: Provides direct outputs.  
- Token Budgeting: Developers can limit reasoning tokens to balance accuracy and latency.  


#### Data and Licensing Framework  

- **Pretraining Corpus**: 6.6T tokens from web-crawl, math, code, and multilingual QA sources.  
- **Data Availability**: Full dataset hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-pre-training-dataset-689d9de36f84279d83786b35) for reproducibility.  
- **License**: [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-open-model-license) permits commercial use but includes compliance requirements.

### NVIDIA's Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2: A Small-Model Challenge to GPT-5  

The [LiveCodeBench leaderboard](https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/livecodebench?models=nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2-reasoning) update triggered significant discussion when NVIDIA's Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 entered the top 5 and outperformed GPT-5 in certain coding benchmarks. A 9-billion-parameter model surpassing a 120-billion-parameter system? While some dismiss the results as metric-specific, the combination of corpus scale, hybrid architecture, and controlled inference mechanisms has sparked a reevaluation of traditional scaling assumptions.  


The "parameter count → performance" narrative has long dominated discussions. NVIDIA's Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 challenges this by achieving competitive results with a fraction of the parameter budget. Key benchmarks include:  

- LiveCodeBench: 71.1% (vs GPT-5's 69.5%)  
- AIME25: 72.1%  
- GPQA: 64.0%  
- MATH500: 97.8%

For startups, research teams, and tool developers, the implications are clear: Does a 9B model suffice where 120B systems were once required?

#### Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Architecture  

Nemotron-Nano employs a hybrid design integrating Mamba-SSM layers with a minimal attention stack:  

| Layer Type | Function | Outcome |  
|------------|----------|---------|  
| Mamba-SSM | Linear-time state-space processing | 4–6x throughput on 128k-token contexts |  
| Attention stacks (4 layers) | Perplexity optimization | Maintains language modeling quality |  

This allows full 128k-token inference on a single A10 GPU, where a 12B Transformer would require multi-GPU setups.  

#### Pruning and Inference Optimization  

The model originated from a 12B base, reduced via 80% pruning and post-training with SFT and DPO. Approximately 5% of the fine-tuning data includes truncated reasoning traces, enabling a configurable "thinking budget" for inference. The PyTorch `generate()` function accepts a `max_thinking_tokens` parameter, balancing accuracy and latency:  

- 32 tokens: Basic logic tasks  
- 512 tokens: Complex mathematical reasoning  

#### Training Corpus  

The 6.6T-token dataset includes:  
- 3.36T from Common Crawl and 4T from code/math corpora  
- 15-language multilingual QA (4M examples)  
- 175B math-code pairs  
- Synthetic reasoning traces from Qwen3-30B and DeepSeek  

This density enables efficient knowledge extraction at lower parameter counts.  

#### Benchmark Performance  

| Benchmark | Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 | GPT-5 |  
|-----------|---------------------|-------|  
| LiveCodeBench | 71.1% | 69.5% |  
| MATH500 | 97.8% | 96.3% |  
| AIME25 | 72.1% | 69.3% |  
| GPQA | 64.0% | 59.6% |  
| IFEval | 90.3% | 88.5% |  
| RULER 128K | 78.9% | 76.8% |
