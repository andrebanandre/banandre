The tech elite's favorite bedtime story goes like this: AGI arrives, makes everyone obsolete, and we all live happily ever after on $10,000 monthly government checks. Former OpenAI researcher Miles Brundage recently floated this fantasy, suggesting AI-enabled growth could make lavish UBI payments "feasible." But this comforting narrative ignores the brutal economic realities and power dynamics that would actually determine our post-AGI future.

## The Perfect Employee That Could End Employment

Imagine an AGI that's smarter than any human at everything, never sleeps, never gets sick, and costs pennies per hour to operate. This isn't science fiction, it's the explicit goal of every major AI lab. The problem isn't whether we can create such systems, but what happens when we succeed.

As one Reddit user bluntly put it: "If 90% of the world is made to suffer, they're going to fight back." The assumption that corporations and governments will voluntarily redistribute wealth through UBI ignores centuries of economic history where technological displacement primarily benefited capital owners, not displaced workers.

## The Math That Doesn't Add Up

Brundage's $10,000/month UBI proposal sounds generous until you run the numbers. For the U.S. alone, that would require approximately $4 trillion annually, nearly the entire current federal budget. The idea that AI-generated productivity gains would automatically fund such payments assumes a political willingness to redistribute wealth that simply doesn't exist in most current power structures.

More realistically, as the Reddit discussion highlighted, UBI might be implemented not out of generosity but as the "cheaper than paying to fix all the damage from vandalism and rioting." This isn't social policy, it's riot prevention.

## The Security State Alternative

The research reveals an even darker possibility: instead of UBI, we might see mass employment in security forces to protect AI-generated wealth. One commenter noted that "paying people to be security" could become the primary form of income distribution, essentially creating a society where the only human jobs involve protecting machines from other humans.

This isn't theoretical. We already see early signs in the growing private security industry and increasingly militarized police forces. AGI could accelerate this trend, creating a world where human value is measured solely by one's ability to protect automated systems.

## The Preparation Gap

The most alarming aspect of the UBI debate is how little serious preparation is actually happening. While researchers like Brundage speculate about $10,000 monthly payments, most current UBI experiments involve $500-1,500 monthly payments, barely subsistence level in many economies.

Meanwhile, the development of AGI safety protocols, ethical frameworks, and economic transition plans lags far behind the capabilities themselves. As Brundage himself admitted after leaving OpenAI: "We're not prepared for this politically, culturally, or otherwise."

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The UBI discussion distracts from more urgent questions: How do we ensure AGI benefits all humanity rather than just a few owners? What mechanisms can prevent catastrophic concentration of power? How do we maintain human purpose and dignity in a post-work world?

These questions require more than just technical solutions or wishful thinking about universal payments. They demand fundamental rethinking of economic systems, power structures, and what it means to live a meaningful life.

The real danger isn't that AGI will make us obsolete, it's that we're building systems that could make most humans permanently economically irrelevant without any plan for what comes next. The UBI fantasy lets us avoid confronting this uncomfortable reality, and that avoidance might be the biggest threat of all.
