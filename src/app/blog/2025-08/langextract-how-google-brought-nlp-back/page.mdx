## The True Cost of Traditional NLP Tools

Unstructured text data is growing at an exponential rate and this is a problem. Valuable insights are often buried in clinical notes, legal contracts, financial reports, customer feedback, and research papers. Traditional methods for extracting meaningful information from these documents are time-consuming, error-prone, and require extensive manual effort. Google recognized that while Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context and generating human-like text, they face specific challenges when tasked with extracting precise, structured information from documents.

Traditional NLP tools like [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/), [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert), or [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) typically rely on rule-based pipelines or fine-tuned models. While they work well for tasks like named-entity recognition or text classification, they struggle with:

- Complex schemas & relationships: Hard to configure without heavy label/data requirements.
- Large documents: Performance drops when extracting scattered facts across long text.
- Traceability: Outputs rarely link back to the original text, making audits or validation difficult.
- Domain adaptation: Each new use case often requires domain-specific fine-tuning.

These limitations make traditional methods slow and resource-intensive at scale.

### The Fine-Tuning Energy Crisis


While everyone focused on pre-training costs, BERT fine-tuning created its own environmental disaster. Each fine-tuning run on document classification tasks generated 125,000+ pounds of CO2 equivalent, more carbon than the average American produces in 6 years [openview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RYvNvCU109&noteId=Uza6s5u9eB).

Traditional fine-tuning of BERT models consumed dozens of kilowatt-hours per run and cost hundreds of dollars. One study found that a single epoch of training TopicBERT consumed enough electricity to power an average home for 3 days [PDF](https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.152.pdf).

#### The Surprising spaCy Hidden Costs

Adapting spaCy to specialized domains (legal, medical, financial) required months of custom training that often cost more than the initial implementation. Companies discovered that "free" models weren't free when customization was required.

While spaCy seemed cheaper upfront, its lower accuracy for complex tasks meant companies needed larger teams to manually verify results. One [financial services company](https://domino.ai/blog/enterprise-class-nlp-with-spacy-v3) reported spending $200,000 annually on human reviewers to catch spaCy's extraction errors.

#### The Production Reality Check

Organizations saw the "free" open-source models and reasonable cloud pricing but discovered that 90% of the real costs were hidden below the surface, infrastructure, talent, energy, maintenance, and opportunity costs.

High implementation costs meant that only large tech companies could afford to experiment with advanced NLP. Smaller organizations were locked out of innovation, creating a dangerous concentration of AI capabilities.

The environmental impact of traditional NLP training became unsustainable. Some organizations abandoned AI projects entirely due to carbon footprint concerns and [ESG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_governance) commitments.

## Just Use LLMs

LLMs have structured input and output, it became cheaper to use, so why not use them for extraction?

Yes, it is true, but not for enterprise use cases. Hallucination is still a problem and it is not easy to fix.

#### Hallucination

For the financial sector, studies show that 68% of extraction errors in financial document processing stem from hallucinated numerical values. BP's Remuneration Report analysis revealed GPT-4 fabricating salary figures, stating Bernard Looney's cash benefits as £230,000 instead of the correct £206,000. In regulated industries, such inaccuracies can trigger compliance violations costing millions.

Healthcare organizations discovered that ChatGPT would confidently extract medication dosages and patient data that didn't exist in the source documents. [One hospital reported](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01079-8) a near-miss where an LLM hallucinated a patient's allergy information, potentially leading to dangerous treatment decisions.

#### Consistency

The same document processed multiple times with identical prompts would produce different results. One Fortune 500 company's CFO described abandoning a $2 million document processing project because quarterly financial reports yielded different extracted values on each run, making automated reconciliation impossible.

#### Cost

Processing large document volumes through commercial LLM APIs became prohibitively expensive.  
Supporting raw LLM document processing required significant infrastructure for prompt management, result validation, and error handling. The "simple ChatGPT solution" ended up requiring dedicated engineering teams.

## How Google tried to solve the problem

LangExtract wasn't just a technical solution, it was Google's response to an industry-wide cost crisis that was killing NLP adoption:

- By providing production-ready capabilities without the hidden infrastructure costs, Google made advanced NLP accessible to organizations that couldn't afford BERT deployments.
- Simple examples-based configuration meant organizations didn't need to hire $300,000 specialists or spend months on custom development.
- LangExtract's optimized processing eliminated the energy waste that made traditional fine-tuning environmentally unsustainable.
- Supporting both cloud and local models freed organizations from expensive GPU infrastructure investments.

### The "Trust Layer"

LangExtract's breakthrough was creating a "trust layer" for LLMs. Instead of replacing LLMs:

- **Controlled Generation**: Uses sophisticated prompt engineering and schema enforcement to guide LLM outputs into consistent, validated formats. This eliminates the format chaos that plagued raw LLM approaches.
- **Precise Source Grounding**: Every extracted piece of information maps back to exact character positions in the source text. This solves the traceability problem that made raw LLMs unsuitable for regulated industries.
- **Multi-Pass Validation**: LangExtract employs redundant questioning and uncertainty-inducing prompts to reduce hallucinations. This approach, validated in academic studies, achieves 90.8% precision and 87.7% recall on constrained datasets.

### Real-World Applications and Use Cases

#### Healthcare: RadExtract

One of the most prominent implementations is [RadExtract](https://huggingface.co/spaces/google/radextract), a specialized version for processing radiology reports. It transforms unstructured clinical narratives into structured sections with clear headers, improving readability and clinical utility. Healthcare organizations can extract medication names, dosages, diagnoses, and administration details from clinical documents, converting them into structured data for analysis and decision-making.

#### Business Intelligence

Companies could leverage LangExtract to extract key entities from news articles, social media posts, and market reports. This enables automated competitive analysis, market trend identification, and lead generation. The tool can process thousands of documents to identify company names, product information, pricing data, and market sentiment indicators.

#### Legal and Financial Services

Law firms and financial institutions use LangExtract to process contracts, extracting clauses, dates, parties, and financial terms. This automation dramatically reduces the time required for document review and ensures consistency in data extraction across large document volumes.

#### Academic and Literary Research

Researchers can analyze entire literary works, extracting character relationships, emotions, and thematic elements. For example, processing the complete text of *Romeo and Juliet* to generate network graphs of character interactions and emotional states.

## The Dark Side of LangExtract

While Google's marketing machine has been in overdrive promoting LangExtract as the solution to enterprise NLP problems, a growing chorus of critics and early adopters are raising serious concerns that challenge the glowing reviews. The reality emerging from production deployments, GitHub issues, and developer forums paints a more complex picture.

### The Vendor Lock-in Trap

Despite claims of flexibility, LangExtract's architecture heavily favors Google's Gemini models. Multiple GitHub issues highlight limited OpenAI compatibility, no native Hugging Face support, and missing Vertex AI service account integration. Critics argue this isn't accidental, it's Google's strategy to lock enterprises into their AI ecosystem.

While LangExtract theoretically supports multiple LLM providers, developers report that non-Gemini models often produce inferior results or fail entirely.  
Organizations that build production systems around LangExtract's Gemini-optimized prompting discover that switching to alternative models requires significant re-engineering. The few-shot examples and prompt patterns that work well with Gemini often fail with other LLMs, creating expensive migration barriers.

### Is it just too raw for enterprise use cases?

The strategy of open source is win-win for big corporations like Google but also for us simple padawans.  
They can test what is working and what is not working, and then build a better product for enterprise, and we can enjoy early access to the best of the best.

Still, it comes with a cost.

Currently, [GitHub issues](https://github.com/google/langextract/issues) are full of bugs and some vulnerabilities.  
Complex state management issues make debugging nearly impossible in production environments.  
Despite claims of efficient processing, users report timeout issues with LLM calls and performance degradation under load. The "optimized chunking" strategies appear to work well in controlled demos but struggle with diverse real-world content.

So is LangExtract just another wrapper? Right now I have a bit of [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) déjà vu: poor documentation, over-abstraction, and frequent breaking changes.
