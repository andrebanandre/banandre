# Related Articles Demo

This page demonstrates the RelatedArticles component that shows related content based on shared tags.

## How it works

The RelatedArticles component:

- **Analyzes tags** from the current post
- **Finds similar posts** based on shared tags  
- **Ranks by similarity** (more shared tags = higher priority)
- **Displays horizontally** with smooth framer-motion animations
- **Follows brutalist design** with your custom styling

## Features

- 🏷️ **Tag-based matching** - finds posts with similar topics
- 🎯 **Smart ranking** - prioritizes posts with more shared tags
- 📱 **Responsive design** - horizontal scroll on all devices
- ⚡ **Smooth animations** - powered by framer-motion
- 🎨 **Brutalist styling** - matches your design system
- 🚀 **Performance optimized** - only loads related content

## Usage Examples

### In MDX files (Easy way)
```mdx
<RelatedArticlesMDX 
  tags="AI,Design,Brutalism" 
  slug="/demo/related-articles-example"
  maxArticles={4} 
/>
```

### In React components (Advanced way)
```tsx
<RelatedArticles 
  currentSlug="/demo/related-articles-example"
  currentTags={["AI", "Design", "Brutalism"]}
  maxArticles={6}
/>
```

Here's the RelatedArticles component in action, looking for posts with similar tags:

<RelatedArticlesMDX 
  tags="Demo,Brutalism" 
  slug="/demo/related-articles-example"
  maxArticles={4} 
/>

> **Note:** If you don't see related articles below, it means there are no other posts with matching tags yet. Create more posts with the tags `#Demo` or `#Brutalism` to see the component in action!
