# Brutal Design Principles: No Compromise

Brutalist design doesn't apologize. It commands attention, demands respect, and delivers functionality without unnecessary decoration.

## Core Principles

- **Raw Materials**: Expose the underlying structure
- **Bold Typography**: Let the message dominate
- **Functional Beauty**: Form follows function, always
